h1. Timesheets

Timesheets is something I knocked up over a few days as a way of playing with some of the new features
introduced in the beta of Rails 3.0.

As a freelancer I need something to keep track of what I'm doing, and for who, and yes there are
lots of very good applications that do that already, but where's the fun in that? So what you have
is a simple application that you can add clients to (defining hourly rates etc), add contacts for that client,
etc.

Invoices are created by choosing a client and a timeframe, any uninvoiced activities in that time period for the client
are added. An activity will only be added to a single invoice. Once an activity is added to an invoice, it can still be edited, deleted, removed from the invoide until the invoice is marked as sent. Once an
invoice has been marked as sent it's details can't be edited (other than to mark it as paid), and it can't be deleted.
